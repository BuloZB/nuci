The internal design
===================

There are several parts inside Nuci, each taking care of different
things.

The netconf interface
---------------------

This is handled by thinly wrapped libnetconf. It parses the XML
messages and calls callbacks and data stores.

The nuci data store
-------------------

This is just an adaptor between libnetconf interface and the
interpreter. It doesn't do much.

There's one data store for each plugin.

The interpreter
---------------

This wraps the Lua interpreter, adds some functions to it and loads
the plugins.

The plugins
-----------

Each plugin is a Lua object registered by the correct function and
with the correct interface. It provides the answers to the queries
from users.
