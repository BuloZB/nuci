This is a graphical testing helper for the uci-raw plugin (as that one was
first). It allows to connect to nuci (well, „connect“ ‒ start it as a
subprocess) and communicate with it. It shows the configuration in a tree structure.

It is possible to select a node in the structure and pre-generate XML snippets
for several operations with the node. The XML can be hand-edited and sent to
the server, or a testcase be generated by it (considering the current response
as correct).

It is expected to be called from the top-level project directory (eg. as
./tools/test_gui/test_gui).

This can also be used as an example how to talk netconf. However:
 • It uses netconf 1.0, which has broken framing format (it uses line with
   ]]>]]> only, but it can legally be part of, for example, a comment).
 • The code quality is of a write-and-throw-away testing tool. In particular,
   it assumes some formatting of the response XML even when not guaranteed by the
   RFC or anything. It just matches the current version. Also, there are
   several known memory leaks and nobody really cares. Don't report those (at
   least not without a patch).
